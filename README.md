# React Employee Directory
For this project, I created a React app that displays all employees of a company in a searchable/sortable interface. 

## App Breakdown
Once the app loads, all employees are displayed by default. Each employeed has a picture, a working phone link, a working email link, and a location that takes you to Google Maps. Team members are able to be searched using the text input, or can be filtered using the two drop-down menus. Images are lazy loaded as you scroll. The entire page is responsive and designed using Bootstrap.
